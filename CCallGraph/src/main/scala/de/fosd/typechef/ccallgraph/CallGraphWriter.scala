     * output format in CSV
     *
     * we distinguish nodes and edges, nodes start with "N" edges with "E"
     *
     * nodes have the following format:
     *
     * N;id;kind;line;name[::container];featureexpr
     *
     * * id is an identifier that only has a meaning within a file and that is not stable over multiple runs
     *
     * * kind is one of "function|function-inline|function-static"
     *   functions are distinguished into functions with an inline or a static modifier (inline takes precedence)
     *
     * * line refers to the starting position in the .pi file
     *
     * * name is either the name of a function or some debug information together with the name of the containing function.
     *   For functions and declarations, the name is used as a reference and can be used to match nodes across files.
     *   For expressions and statements, the name is used for debugging only and returns the first characters of the statement.
     *   In this case, the name is however followed by :: and the function name that can be used to extract hierarchy information.
     *   Note that function names should be unique in the entire system for each configuration (that is, there may be multiple
     *   functions with the same name but mutually exclusive feature expressions)
     *
     * * featureexpr describes the condition when the node is included
     *
     * edges do not have a line and title:
     *
     * E;sourceid;targetid;featureexpr;kind
     *
     * * kind is of of D|I|FNNF|ECNF => this is used to measure how precise is our pointer analysis (how many pointers are not resolved)
     *
     * they connect nodes within a file
     * ids refer to node ids within the file
     * nodeids are always declared before edges connecting them
     *
     * edges between files are not described in the output, but must be computed separately with an external linker
     * that matches nodes based on function/declaration names
